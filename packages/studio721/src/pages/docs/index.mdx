## Introduction

Welcome! In these docs we'll cover everything you need to know to start creating
NFTs.

Section 1 is a guide for learning how NFTs work, which covers smart contracts,
token metadata, and asset files.

In Section 2, we'll look at some of the tools you can use to create these
things. We'll primarily focus on the tools that are part of this site, Studio
721 ⁠— however, most of the knowledge will be equally useful more generally.

Studio 721 and these docs were created by me,

## Who is this for?

These docs are intended for people who are already familiar with cryptocurrency,
wallets, and _collecting_ NFTs. They'll assume you're comfortable with e.g.
signing transactions using a wallet like MetaMask.

You'll also see developer terminology used throughout these docs, e.g. JSON.
While you don't need to be a professional developer to create NFTs, creating
NFTs is fundamentally somewhat technical, so it's valuable to familiarize
yourself with the terms if they're new to you.
